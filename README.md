# expense_tracker

A simple expense tracker app that I did as a part of Udemy course on Flutter. It tracks all inserted expenses, displays them in a list (from the oldest to the newest) and shows a graph of total expenses by categories. The app support dark and light themes, responsive to the device orientation.
